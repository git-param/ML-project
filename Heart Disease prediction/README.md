# 🩺 Health Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting health outcomes using machine learning algorithms. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and predictions based on health-related features.

## 📁 File Structure

```
health_prediction.ipynb        # Main Jupyter Notebook with code and outputs
```

## 🚀 Features

- Loading and preprocessing the health dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights  
- Feature selection and normalization  
- Machine learning model implementation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using performance metrics  
- Accuracy comparison of different models  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📦 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed. Use pip to install required packages:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

2. Launch the notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook health_prediction.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells in order to see the full analysis and model output.

## 📈 Model Insights

- Multiple models were trained to predict health status.  
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report were used.  
- The best-performing model can be identified at the end of the notebook.  

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Use a larger or real-world dataset for better generalization.  
- Build a simple frontend using Streamlit or Flask to interact with the model.  
- Implement model deployment for real-time prediction.
